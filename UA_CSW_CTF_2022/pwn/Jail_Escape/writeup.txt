Jail Escape.

This challenge is complex and contains elements from how python itself works and the requests module.

Looking at the source code, we have access to an exec function, which executes whatever python code we insert,
but not freely, as some strings are restricted.

Let me take you through the journey I made in order to solve this challenge:

At first, I tried searching for an OS module method named `get`, since it was hinted that the solution would be related to get.

After that yielded nothing, I went and googled `python jail break`, to see if there are similiar challenges.

I found some blog about some similiar challenge: https://anee.me/escaping-python-jails-849c65cf306e

In it was a part of the solution: using __builtins__.__dict__['COMMAND'.lower()].

Using this syntax gives us the ability to evade the restricted strings, even when running functions,

Since:

__builtins__.__dict__['FUNCTION'.lower()](param)

Is the same as running:

function(param)

Using this syntax we can also import modules and use them with the power of __import__:

__builtints__.__dict__['__IMPORT__'.lower()]('MODULE_NAME'.lower()).__dict__['FUNCTION'.lower()](param)

Which is the same as:

module_name.function(param)

Using this neat trick, I imported the `OS` module and executed the bash command by calling system:

__builtins__.__dict__['__IMPORT__'.lower()]('OS'.lower()).__dict__['SYSTEM'.lower()]('bash')

... And that got me shell!

I searched for a while for a flag, using find:

find / -name "flag" 
And
find / -name "localhost"

But it didn't return a location.

So I read the challenge instruction again, and having the GET be uppercased made the penny drop:
~I need to use the requests module in order to send a GET request to localhost!

Using the trick mentioned above, I crafted this python one liner:

print(__builtins__.__dict__['__IMPORT__'.lower()]('REQUESTS'.lower()).__dict__['GET'.lower()]('http://'+'LOCALHOST'.lower()).text)

In order to reach the flag file on localhost. (localhost is capitalized because it contains 'os' which is banned)
