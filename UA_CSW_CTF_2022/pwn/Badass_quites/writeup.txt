Walk-through:
After wget'ing the chal.c file, i opened it and saw the "gets" vulnerable function, alongside two unused strings, "term" and "quote".

These strings are initiated as z-filled, which means it is filled with 0's, not as characters, but as ascii values of the chars.

Then the "gets" function is called to get a value for "qoute", which is 32 char's long, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

How? 

First we must understand:

The vulnerability in "gets" is in play here:
the function "gets" doesn't check the buffer it tries to insert into the variable, so if we insert a string longer than the variable can hold, an overflow would occurre, causing the next variable's content to be filled with the overflowed data.

Knowing that we can get the flag:

Going through the code we can understand our "win condition", the case in which we get the flag, happends when the variable `term` is equal to "BaDaSs I Am".

The way to change the value of `term` is by overflowing the variable quote, so Inserting the string:

abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdBaDaSs I Am

Would cause value of `quote` to be:
"abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd"

And the value of `term` to be:
"BaDaSs I Am"

So the flag is shown.
