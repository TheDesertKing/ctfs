There's a lot to this challenge, it involves many different tools:

Firstly - the WayBack machine! it is used through the tweeter to find the deleted tweet he mentioned he's so lucky to have been able to delete, which leads us to a github user name.

Looking at the GitHub profile, there are only two commits made by it to it's repository, the most recent one removes one 'log.txt' file.

Inside said file, we have a bit.ly link, linking to a wav file in stored on mega.nz, a morse code that decodes to some instructions.

from the instructions we get to download a pdf image and open in through it's password, which is a 'swift code' of the bank having the bin code we are provided.
