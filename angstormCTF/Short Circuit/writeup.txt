This challenge is quite straight forward:
	Login verification is done client side,
	thus password is "cleartext".

Exept it's scrambled so some reverse engineering
of the `chunk` and `swap` function are required,
in order to understand the password we need to put in
for it to turn out to be the string that our input
is validated against.
