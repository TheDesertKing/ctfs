This challenge revolves around understanding python
server-side code, as we are provided with the site's source.

It's a short script the conditions are quite simple:

```python

num_hosts = 0
for name, value in headers:
    if name == b"host":
        num_hosts += 1

if num_hosts == 1:
    for name, value in headers:
        if name == b"host" and value == SECRET_SITE:
            await send({
                'type': 'http.response.body',
                'body': FLAG.encode(),
            })
            return
```

The first block of code checks whether the request we sent
contains a header named `host`, if so, execute the next block.

The second block checks if the value the `host` header was
set to is equal to the value of the variable SECRET_SITE,
which is set on line 4:

```python
SECRET_SITE = b"flag.local"
```

So the check is whether the `host` header was set to `flag.local`,
and if so, the flag is displayed!
