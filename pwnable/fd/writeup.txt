At first I checked the `atoi` C function, to understand whether it treats it's parameter as hex-string or int-string. It treats it as int-string.
There are a few special file descriptors I'll like to check: 0,1,2 as these correlate to: `stdin`,`stdout`,`stderr`, respectively.

Checked out what 0x1234 correlates for in base-10 using python: python3 -c "print(int(0x1234))" --> 4660.

This line in the source C code of fd:

```if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){```

seems to be the win-condition, where buf is coming from:

```len = read(fd, buf, 32)```

which means the value in buf is read from the file with the filedescriptor `fd`, which it's value comes from:

```int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234```

so `fd` will be equal to whatever value we put in argv[1] minus 4660, so if we do:

$ ./fd VALUE

`fd`'s value will be VALUE - 4660, so if VALUE == 4660, the input for `buf` will be from the file decriptor 0, which is `stdin`, that means we can input whatever 32 chars into `buf` we want.

In order to reach our win-condition, `buf` has to contain: "LETMEWIN\n", so all we need to do is:

$ ./fd 4660
LETMEWIN				(this is the `stdin` the program waits for before executing the rest of the code)

And press Enter (which adds `\n` to the "LETMEWIN" string), the flag will be catted!

FLAG: good job :)
