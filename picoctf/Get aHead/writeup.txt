This is an easy challenge, there are two buttons that redirect us to the same page with a different background color, red and blue.

The difference between the two requests are that red is GET and blue is POST.

I tried DELETE just to see, but then I had remembered the name of the challenge:
Get aHead!

So trying to send a HEAD request returns the flag in the response headers!
