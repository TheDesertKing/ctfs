scuffed writeup incomin
broke my head for 2 long on this' so I read a writeup, shoulda known its leaking off the stack...
welp, i'm new to this so oh well.
then i got it in little endian, worked in python to reformat it from hex to the flag
which for me is:
picoCTF{I_l05t_4ll_my_m0n3y_bdc425ea}
damn. I suck at binary exp.
